This project focuses on the design and development of a custom motherboard using a rk3588. The goal is to create a compact, high-performance solution tailored for embedded systems and other specialized applications. The motherboard will feature a variety of interfaces for connectivity, expansion, and power management, all while leveraging Rockchip’s powerful processor architecture.  


Project Objectives

The project had both technical and design objectives:

Design a functional schematic of a custom RK3588 motherboard with essential peripherals and expansion options.

Develop a compact PCB layout, ensuring signal integrity, power stability, and thermal management.

Integrate various interfaces, including USB, Ethernet, MIPI camera inputs, HDMI outputs, and PCIe expansion.

Design a robust power management system, capable of handling multiple voltage rails efficiently.

Prototype and test the motherboard for functionality, stability, and performance
