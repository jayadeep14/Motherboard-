This project focuses on the design and development of a custom motherboard using a rk3588. The goal is to create a compact, high-performance solution tailored for embedded systems and other specialized applications. The motherboard will feature a variety of interfaces for connectivity, expansion, and power management, all while leveraging Rockchipâ€™s powerful processor architecture.
